Algorithm Visualizer

This project is a web-based tool for visualizing various sorting and searching algorithms. It provides a user-friendly interface to watch algorithms in action, helping to understand their underlying mechanics.

Features

Algorithm Visualization: Watch sorting and searching algorithms as they process an array of numbers.

Multiple Algorithms: Includes a variety of common algorithms:

Sorting: Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.

Searching: Linear Search and Binary Search.

Interactive Controls:

Start/Stop: Play and pause the visualization at any time.

Array Size: Adjust the number of elements in the array.

Speed Control: Change the visualization speed to observe the steps more clearly.

Generate New Array: Create a new random array to visualize.

Algorithm Information: Displays time and space complexity, along with a C++ code implementation for the selected algorithm.
